# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **system_prompt_gen** project that appears to be in early development stages. The repository currently contains minimal structure with only basic files.

## Current Repository State

The project is currently a blank slate with:
- Basic Python-focused `.gitignore` (includes Python, virtual environments, IDEs, and modern Python tooling)
- Minimal README.md
- Git repository initialized on `develop` branch (main branch: `main`)

## Development Setup

Since no specific build tools, dependencies, or configuration files are present, development commands will depend on what gets added to the project. Common Python project patterns suggest this may use:

- Package managers: pip, poetry, pipenv, uv, or pdm (based on .gitignore patterns)
- Virtual environment management
- Testing frameworks (pytest patterns in .gitignore)
- Code formatting/linting tools (ruff cache patterns in .gitignore)

## Architecture Notes

The project structure is not yet established. The name suggests this will be a system for generating prompts, likely AI/ML related given the naming convention.

## Development Notes

- The project uses git with `develop` as current branch and `main` as the main branch
- The .gitignore is comprehensive and supports multiple Python tooling ecosystems
- No source code, configuration, or dependency files exist yet

This CLAUDE.md will need updates as the project architecture and tooling are established.
